# General Notes

## Colons

_For now, think of them as strings (will study more in Ch 8)._

- Elements starting with colons are symbols.

## Self

- Default object
- In the topmost level of a class definition body, `self` is the object itself
- There is always a `self` defined when program is running

## Double Colons

`::`

- Allows access to constant outside of class definition

## Or-Equals Operator

`||=`

- Conditionally sets a value
- Sets the variable to the specified value

## Syntactic Sugar

Special rules that let you write your code
in a way that doesn't correspond to the normal rules
but that's easier to remember how to do and looks better.
