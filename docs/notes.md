# Puts vs Print

- `puts` - adds a newline to the end of the string it prints out.
  - Provided the string doesn't end in one already.
  - Short for " put (that is, print) string"
- `print` - prints out the string you ask it to and then stops.
  - It doesn't automatically jump to the next line.

# Gets

- `gets` - Get a line of keyboard input

# Rake Task

- `rake` - reads and executes tasks defined in a file (a Rakefile).
  - Example: `$ rake admin:clean_tmp`

# Methods

## Arguments

_Common to say `Arguments` to distinguish between `Formal` and `Arguments`_

### Formal

- The variables listed in the method definition

### Arguments

- Values supplied to the method when it's called.

## Return Values

- `return value` is the result of calling a method
- Every method has a return value even if it's just `nil`
