# General Notes

## Colons

_For now, think of them as strings (will study more in Ch 8)._

- Elements starting with colons are symbols.

## Self

- Default object
- In the topmost level of a class definition body, `self` is the object itself
- There is always a `self` defined when program is running

## Double Colons

`::`

- Allows access to constant outside of class definition

## Or-Equals Operator

`||=`

- Conditionally sets a value
- Sets the variable to the specified value

## Classes

- Define clusters of behavior or functionality.
- Every object is an instance of exactly one class.
- Example:
  - `String` is a class.
  - Every time a string is created, it creates an instance of the class `String`
- Responsible for launching the object into existence (Instantiation)
